# Scrumbot

An open-source simple standup meeting assistant for Slack.

## Installation

You can install the Scrumbot from its [Web page](http://scrumbot.sifts.io/ "Scrumbot Website").

## Versions

This repository contains a branch (tutorial) which reflects the screencast on how to write
a scrumbot on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJZGaaEWEsc&t=865s),
and a slightly different one (release) which reflects the version used for the Slack 
directory. The tutorial omits some details required for submission to the Slack
App directory, like the help command, and some code which covers edge conditions.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the project and use it as you wish. If you think that others might benefit from your changes, send us a pull request.
